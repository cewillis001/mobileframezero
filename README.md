First Go
--------

This is going to be the readme file for this project. It isn't much of anything at the moment. Still learning.

Another Thing
-------------

This project is meant to be a test of how I'm learning ruby, and also a way to automate the combat turns of Mobile Frame Zero so I can play it better while tipsy. Or sleepy. You know.
